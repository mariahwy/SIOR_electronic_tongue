# SIOR_electronic_tongue

## Overview
This repository is about 'Naerumi', the **electronic tongue** that mimics the human taste receptors.
This robot was created as part of a project for the **SIOR** exhibition at Sungkyunkwan University's Robotics Club.



### Description
- The human taste receptors have different protein structures depending on the five basic tastes, and the brain perceives different flavors based on the **pattern** in which each taste receptor interacts with taste molecules.
- This electronic tongue can measure the degrees of **sweetness, saltiness, and sourness** to identify the type of taste.
- Receiving values from multiple sensors and storing them in a database.
- Based on the collected data, a model was trained using **multiple logistic regression**, enabling real-time flavor analysis.

### Technologies
- Arduino Uno
- Ethernet shield
- Sensors: `pH`, `TDS`, `salinity`, and `light`
- ML

### Development
- Utilized as an auxiliary medical device.
- Used as an objective indicator of taste.
- Proactive judgment of spoiled food.
